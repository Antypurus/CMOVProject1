\section{Architecture}

\subsection{Server}

\subsubsection{REST WebAPI}
\hspace{0.6cm}
The server uses a REST WebAPI provided by the ASP.NET framework to handle all the communication with it. All routes are present in a single controller under the router of server. 

\subsubsection{Database}
\hspace{0.6cm}
Communication with the PostgreSQL database is done using the Npgsql package, it is then abstracted into a singleton class that provides the common insert and select operation. Prepared
statements are done via an entry system where each entry has a name, a value and a boolean indicating if the entry is a UUID or not, the entry names are then matched to the
query markers for parameters.

All responses to select queries are done via list of dictionaries that map strings to object, each element in the list is a row in the database, and the elements of the dictionaries
contain the values of the various columns in the database, the entries have the same name as they do in the database schema.

\subsubsection{RSA Encryption \& Signing}
\hspace{0.6cm}
Encryption is done using the .NET Crypto Service Providers, specifically RSA Crypto Service Provider, as well as the BouncyCastle package that is used for parsing and exporting public and private
keys to and from the PEM string format. This is also done with a singleton class that exposes Encryption, Decryption, Signing and Verifying data methods.

Any encrypted data or signatures are in Base64 format, while all data to be verified or encrypted are expected to be in a Unicode UTF-16 encoding.

\subsection{Store And Client Applications}

\subsubsection{HTTP Requests}
\hspace{0.6cm}
All HTTP requests are done via static methods that make use of standard Java facilities such as URL and HttpUrlConnection. All requests are run in an Android AsyncTask so as not
to block the UI main thread of Android. Each request method also receive an instant of a class called HTTPResultHandler, this class handles the result of the HTTP request once
it is ready, and this is done via its Handler method.

\subsubsection{QR Codes}
\hspace{0.6cm}
QR Code handling is done via the Google Zebra Crossing (zxing) library and some of its android integrations, methods are provided for generating a
QR code and for reading a QR code.

QR code generation is rather straightforward with a method call that returns a Bitmap.

QR code reading is a bit more involved as it makes use of the external bar code scanner application and requires the activity to override its onActivityResult method, therefore
to simplify this system and force QR code reader users to properly overload this method we have created an Android Activity that is abstract and forces its subclasses to
implement a handler that it will internally call when the onActivityResult method is triggered.

\subsubsection{RSA Encryption \& Signing}
\hspace{0.6cm}
RSA encryption and signing is done via the standard java facilities for security purposes and Androids KeyStore facilities. When a new user is registed a new private key public key
pair is introduced into the Android Secure Key Store Enclave.

All further usages of this class are done via static methods that when needed receive the username of the user, so that they can fetch his key for various security purposes.

This class offers static methods for encryption, decryption, signing and verifying data.

\subsubsection{Data Caching}
\hspace{0.6cm}
All data caching is done via the Android SharedPreferences Facilities.

\end{minted}
\subsubsection{Client}
\hspace{0.6cm}
This table contains information about users of the platform and has the following fields:
\begin{itemize}
    \item id - UUID representing the identification of the user.
    \item name - String representing the name of the user.
    \item username - String representing the username or nickname of the user.
    \item password - String representing the password of the user.
    \item credit\textunderscore card - Integer representing the credit card number of the user.
    \item public\textunderscore key - String containing the users RSA public key.
    \item current\textunderscore total\textunderscore spent\textunderscore euro - The amount of money spent by the user, this is the euro component.
    \item current\textunderscore total\textunderscore spent\textunderscore cent - The amount of money spent by the user, this is the cent component.
    \item current\textunderscore accumulated\textunderscore euro - The amount of money the user has accumulated from voucher, this is the euro component.
    \item current\textunderscore accumulated\textunderscore cent - The amount of money the user has accumulated from voucher, this is the cent component.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Voucher}
\hspace{0.6cm}
This table contains the voucher registered in the system and has the following details:
\begin{itemize}
    \item id - UUID representing the identification of the voucher.
	\item client - UUID representing the identification of the user the voucher belongs to.
	\item was\textunderscore used - Boolean representing wether or not the voucher has been used, by default this value is false.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Purchase}
\hspace{0.6cm}
This table contains information about purchases and has the following details:
\begin{itemize}
    \item id - UUID representing the identification of the purchase.
	\item client - UUID representing the identification of the user the purchase is associated with.
	\item voucher - UUID representing the identification of the voucher used in this purchase, this value is optional and is null by default.
	\item should\textunderscore discount - Boolean representing weather or not the cost of the purchase was amortized with money the user had accumulated via vouchers.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Product}
\hspace{0.6cm}
This table contains the products registered in the system and has the following information:
\begin{itemize}
    \item id - UUID representing the identification of the product.
	\item price\textunderscore euro - This is the price of the product, this is the euros component.
	\item price\textunderscore cent - This is the price of the product, this is the cents component.
	\item name - String representing the name of the product.

\section{Features \& Tests}

\subsection{Features}

\subsubsection{Available Product List In Store App}
\hspace{0.6cm}
In the store app there is a list of all products currently available in the system along with their prices, if a user click the product
he will be displayed the corresponding QR code. All products are signed by the server to validate they have been issued by a trusted source.

\subsubsection{User Registering}
\hspace{0.6cm}
Users have the ability to register via the client application, they need to provide their name, username, password and credit card, the user
will then be assigned an UUID identifier and a public and private key will be generated for him and security stored in Androids Secure Key Store.

\subsubsection{User Login}
\hspace{0.6cm}
The user is able to login into his account by providing his username and password, this login is merely local and servers to retrieve the server keys
and the user data. If a user registers with the same username as a previously existing user, he will overwrite that users local data.

\subsubsection{User Login Caching}
\hspace{0.6cm}
User login data is cached so that the user only needs to login in case he explicitly logs out of the system.

\subsubsection{Adding Products To Cart Through QR Codes}
\hspace{0.6cm}

\subsubsection{Viewing and Editing Cart}
\hspace{0.6cm}

\subsubsection{Viewing Past Transaction}

\subsection{Testing}
\hspace{0.6cm}
Testing of the several apps has been done in acceptance test format, listing out what each feature needs to do and proceeding to manually test them, attempting to cover all
possible edge case scenarios.
